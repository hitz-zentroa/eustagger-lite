INSTRUCCIONES PARA PROBAR EUSTAGGER LITE 
========================================

We have tested Eustagger Lite in several GNU/Linux versions, some newer than 
others (from RHEL5 to Ubuntu 17.10). The following instructions should work 
for Ubuntu 12.04-13.10 and Fedora 18-20.

Eustagger Lite has the following dependencies:

pcre++ (tested with version 0.9.5)
vislcg 3 (tested with version 20130826)
SWI Prolog (tested with versions 5.10.5 and 6.0, 7 doesn't work)
Foma (tested with version 0.9.17)
Freeling (tested with version 3.1)
Boost (tested with version 1.53)

At the same time, those libriries and programs have their own dependencies.
Some of them can be instaled from the official repositories of those
GNU/Linux repositories (package names may differ in newer distros):

Ubuntu:
=======

        $ apt-get install subversion make cmake cpp libicu48 libicu-dev\
          autoconf bison flex swi-prolog zlib1g zlib1g-dev libpcre3 libpcre3-dev\
          libpcre++0 libpcre++-dev libboost-all-dev

Fedora:
=======

        $ yum install subversion make cmake gcc-c++ libicu libicu-devel\
          autoconf bison flex pl pl-devel zlib zlib-devel pcre pcre-devel\
          boost boost-devel

Eustagger Lite and his dependencies must be compiled with GCC 4 or 5.

In Fedora pcre++ should be installed by hand. For that:

        $ wget http://www.daemon.de/idisk/Apps/pcre++/pcre++-0.9.5.tar.gz
        or from our server
        $ wget http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/eustagger/pcre++-0.9.5.tar.gz

        decompress and install in the selected prefix:

        $ tar -zxvf pcre++-0.9.5.tar.gz
        $ cd pcre++-0.9.5
        $ ./configure (in some 64 bit systems --with-pcre-lib=/usr/lib64 is also needed)
        $ make
        $ make install

(the default prefix is /usr/local, if wanted to change it use the --prefix option 
in configure)


NEEDS MANUAL INSTALLATION:

SWI prolog
==========

If distro's SWI is >=7 you must compile and install version 5.x or 6.X.

foma:
=====

Donwload:

        $ wget https://foma.googlecode.com/files/foma-0.9.17.tar.gz
        or from our server
        $ wget http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/eustagger/foma-0.9.17.tar.gz

Decompress, compile and install:

        $ tar -zxvf foma-0.9.17.tar.gz
        $ cd foma-0.9.17
        $ make
        $ make install

(the default prefix is /usr/local, if wanted to change it modify the Makefile)

vislcg3:
========

Donwload:

        $ wget http://beta.visl.sdu.dk/download/vislcg3/vislcg3-20130826.tar.gz
        o from our server:
        $ wget http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/eustagger/vislcg3-20130826.tar.gz

Decompress, compile and install (cmake is needed):

        $ tar -zxvf vislcg3-20130826.tar.gz
        $ cd vislcg3-20130826
        $ ./cmake.sh
        $ make -j3
        $ make install

Copy the *.h and *.hpp files to our installation prefix (/usr/local/include by default):

        $ cp src/*.h src/*.hpp /usr/local/include

(If wanted to change the prefix pass the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path to cmake.sh)
(If couldn't found the Boost library export the following environment variables
BOOST_ROOT=/instalacion_boost)


Freeling 3.1
============

We tested the Freeling 3.1 (3.0 version doesn't work)

Download:

	http://devel.cpl.upc.edu/freeling/downloads/32

	or from our server

        $ wget http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/eustagger/freeling-3.1.tar.gz


Decompress, compile and install:

        $ tar -zxvf freeling-3.1.tar.gz
        $ cd freeling-3.1
        ( In fedora/RH: $ export LDFLAGS=-lboost_system )
        $ ./configure --disable-warnings
        $ make
        $ make install

* If wanted to change the default boost instalation by another one, before the 
configure command execute the following:

$ export LDFLAGS="-L/mi_instalacion_de_boost/lib -lboost_system"
$ export CPPFLAGS="-I/mi_instalacion_de_boost/include"


* When copiling Freeling 3.1 the following error may happend:

../../src/include/freeling/morfo/foma_FSM.h:1: error: stray '\357' in program
../../src/include/freeling/morfo/foma_FSM.h:1: error: stray '\273' in program
../../src/include/freeling/morfo/foma_FSM.h:1: error: stray '\277' in program

Remove the first comment lines from the src/include/freeling/morfo/foma_FSM.h file
to solve the problem.
 

eustagger: 
==========

Download eustagger (already in this directory?):

        $ svn co https://siuc05.si.ehu.es/svn/eustagger/trunk/eustagger
        o directly:
        $ wget http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/eustagger/eustagger_latest.tar.bz2

Compile and install

        $ cd eustagger
        $ autoconf
	$ ./configure

	If swipl of the operating system is used there will probably needed
	to indicate where the files are with the "--with-swipl-include="
	and "--with-lib-include=" options. For example in Ubuntu, add
	"--with-swipl-include=/usr/lib/swi-prolog/include"...
	
 (in Ubuntu add: --with-swipl-include=/usr/lib/swi-prolog/include)
	$ make
	$ make install

The default prefix is /usr/local. If wanted to change it use the --prefix option
for configure. If any library can be found, there options to indicate where look
for them. List all options executing './configure --help'

Different GNU/Linux distributions place swipl header in different places. For example
in Ubuntu, you need to use the --with-swipl-include=/usr/lib/swi-prolog/include option
to found those headers.

Finally, before try eustagger you need to change the following envaironment variables:

	$ export IXA_PREFIX=nuestro_prefix (/usr/local?)
	$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=nuestro_prefix/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

Execute eustagger with the following command:

	$ eustagger_lite fichero_de_texto.txt
